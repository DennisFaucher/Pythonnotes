# PythonNotes

Sort of an Obsidian clone written by GoogleGemini after many iterations of coaching
Runs on both Linux and MacOS (after installing GTK). 
I need to add a requirements.txt. The hardest part is getting the gi python library installed

##### Weird Quirks currently

- Make sure all lines have two spaces at then end if not wrapping correctly
- Only use bulleted lists not numbered lists. I haven't written that yet
- Parentheses and Brackets seem to be formatted as some sort of heading. Only if they have a horizontal line (---) following them. Interesting.
- Cannot include emojis, colons, astricks in note names
- If you want to scale the images and the scale to work in WeasyPrint PDF, you need to use this scale format:
```
![AltText 128px Width](../../images/image.jpg){: style="width: 128px !important;" }
```
- Tabbed bullets work, but hitting Enter after a tabbed bullet only creates a normal bullet ATM
